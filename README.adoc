= Clojure Demo Project

Clojure demo project

== How to User This Project

To use this project, we assume you have already installed Java, Clojure, and Leiningen, and `git`.

=== Verify you have Java & Clojure set up correctly

Try the following commands, and make sure you get similar output:

```bash
> java --version
java 21 2019-09-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 13+33)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 13+33, mixed mode, sharing)

> clojure --version
Clojure CLI version 1.11.1.1208
```

== Running Unit Tests - Plain

I use the alias `ct` for "clojure-test" and `ctr` fr "clojure-test-refresh". You can copy that or just cut/paste
the actual commands echoed below.

Simple way:
```pre
> time (clojure -X:test)

Running tests in #{"test"}

Testing tst._bootstrap

--------------------------------------
   Clojure 1.12.0-alpha5    Java 21
--------------------------------------

Testing tst.demo.core

Ran 9 tests containing 36 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.

== Keeping Dependency Versions Up-To-Date

This `deps.edn` includes the `old` alias, which will tell you if any of your dependency
libraries are out of date. I have a BASH alias:

```bash
> which cold
cold () {
	evalEcho 'time (clojure -M:old)'
}
```

which will give you a list of version updates you should make, or just

```pre
> cold
time (clojure -M:old)
[##################################################] 6/6
All dependencies are up-to-date.
  28.14s user 0.67s system 370% cpu 7.782 total
```

if you are already up-to-date on everything.

== Plumatic Schema

The function `demo.core/add2` shows the usage of https://github.com/plumatic/schema[Plumatic Schema] to document
function argument types and return value type.  This is a lifesaver!
